# GigKavach 🛡️
### AI-Powered Parametric Insurance for India's Gig Economy
**Guidewire DEVTrails 2026 — University Hackathon**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

India's gig workers (Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto, Amazon, Uber, Ola) form the backbone of our digital economy. External disruptions like extreme weather, floods, curfews, and strikes can reduce their working hours and cause **20–30% loss in monthly earnings**. Currently, gig workers have **zero income protection** against these uncontrollable events.

**GigKavach** is an AI-enabled parametric insurance platform that safeguards gig workers against income loss caused by external disruptions — with automated payouts, intelligent fraud detection, and a weekly pricing model aligned with their earnings cycle.

## 👤 Persona-Based Scenarios & Workflow

### Personas Covered

| Persona | Platforms | Key Risk |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Food Delivery | Zomato, Swiggy | Heavy rain, floods halt deliveries |
| Quick Commerce | Zepto, Blinkit | Extreme heat, pollution stop work |
| Package Delivery | Amazon Flex, Dunzo, Porter | Curfews, strikes block zones |
| Rideshare (Uber) | Uber | Flooding, social unrest |
| Rideshare (Ola) | Ola | Extreme weather, bandh |

### Scenario Example — Ravi (Zomato Delivery Partner, Mumbai)

```
Day 1: Ravi registers on GigKavach
  → Completes KYC (Aadhaar + eShram + Identity Proof)
  → PyTorch model calculates risk score: 42% (MEDIUM)
  → Weekly premium assigned: ₹52/week

Day 2: Ravi buys a 4-week policy
  → Pays ₹208 via UPI
  → Policy activated instantly

Day 5: Heavy floods hit Mumbai (weather severity: 85%)
  → GigKavach auto-trigger detects the event
  → Claim filed automatically on Ravi's behalf
  → Isolation Forest confirms: not fraud
  → Random Forest approves: 91% confidence
  → ₹840 credited to Ravi's UPI within 5 minutes
  → Ravi never had to do anything
```

## 💰 Weekly Premium Model

### Why Weekly?
Gig workers are paid **weekly**, not monthly. A monthly premium creates cash flow problems. GigKavach aligns the premium cycle with their earnings cycle.

### How Premium is Calculated (PyTorch Neural Network)

```
Weekly Premium = Base Rate × City Tier Multiplier × (1 + Risk Score × 0.9)
```

**Base Rates by Persona:**
| Persona | Base Rate | Max Payout |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Food Delivery | ₹45/week | ₹1,500 |
| Quick Commerce | ₹40/week | ₹1,200 |
| Package Delivery | ₹50/week | ₹1,800 |
| Rideshare Uber | ₹60/week | ₹2,500 |
| Rideshare Ola | ₹55/week | ₹2,200 |

**Risk Score (PyTorch 5-layer Neural Network, 13 features):**
```python
risk_score = (
    0.35 × weather_severity +
    0.35 × social_disruption +
    0.15 × historical_claim_rate +
    0.10 × (1 - experience_factor) +
    0.05 × (1 - hours_factor)
)
```

**Premium range: ₹35 – ₹95 per week**

## ⚡ Parametric Triggers

### What is a Parametric Trigger?
Unlike traditional insurance (where you prove your loss), parametric insurance pays automatically when a **pre-defined event** crosses a **threshold** — no paperwork needed.

### GigKavach Triggers

| Trigger Type | Event | Threshold | Auto-Payout |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Environmental | Extreme Heat | Temp > 42°C | Yes |
| Environmental | Heavy Rain | Rain > 50mm/hr | Yes |
| Environmental | Flash Flood | Severity > 70% | Yes |
| Environmental | Severe Pollution | AQI > 400 | Yes |
| Social | Curfew | Govt. declared | Yes |
| Social | Bandh / Strike | Verified report | Yes |
| Social | Zone Closure | Platform API | Yes |

### Real-time Monitoring
The auto-trigger system scans all active policies every hour:
```
Scan active policies → Check weather API → If severity > 70%
→ Auto-file claim → Fraud check → Approve → UPI payout
```

## 🤖 AI/ML Integration

### 1. Risk Assessment — PyTorch Neural Network
- **Architecture:** 5-layer fully connected network
- **Input features:** 13 (persona, city tier, income, experience, hours, weather severity, social disruption, AQI, rainfall, temperature, day of week, time bucket, claim history)
- **Output:** Risk score (0–1) → Premium amount
- **Training:** 5,000 synthetic samples, 80 epochs, BCELoss, Adam optimizer

### 2. Fraud Detection — Scikit-learn Isolation Forest
- **Algorithm:** Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- **Features:** Claimed loss ratio, weather severity, social disruption, hours reported, historical fraud score, location match
- **Contamination rate:** 8%
- **Output:** Fraud flag (CLEAN / FLAGGED) + anomaly score

### 3. Claim Classification — Scikit-learn Random Forest
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (100 trees, max depth 8)
- **Features:** Weather severity, social disruption, claimed loss ratio, hours lost, location match, fraud score, policy age
- **Output:** APPROVED / REJECTED + confidence score

### ML Pipeline Flow
```
Claim Filed
    ↓
Isolation Forest → Fraud Check (is_fraud: true/false)
    ↓
Random Forest → Approval Decision (probability: 0-1)
    ↓
If approved → Instant UPI Payout
```
